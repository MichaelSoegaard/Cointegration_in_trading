![Cointegration - Statistical Arbritrage](../img/cointegration.png)

Cointegration spread trading is a statistical arbitrage strategy for trading financial assets. You basicially trade two cointegrated assets, that is two assets that have the same price fluctuations and long term movement. But when they once in a while move apart from each they tend to revert bak to the mean at some point. It's that knowledge you can use to your advantage.
Practially you buy one af the assets and sell the other, This way you can remove the risk of being affected by the general market movements, which is a huge advantage. The downside is you're also hedging a lot of your profit unless you use some really clever stoploss/risk strategy in combination with your hedging.
