#### Introduction
Cointegration spread trading is a statistical arbitrage strategy for trading financial assets. You basicially trade two cointegrated assets, that is two assets that have the same price fluctuations and long term movement. But when they once in a while move apart from each they tend to revert back to the mean at some point. It's that knowledge you can use to your advantage.
Practically you buy one af the assets and sell the other, This way you can remove the risk of being affected by the general market movements, which is a huge advantage. 

In the past it was possible to use mean-reverting strategies to trade assets and you could be profitable. But as with most all trading strategies, as they are used by more and more people they loose their edge and stops being profitable. I don't expect this strategy to be higly profitable.
#### Goal
I want to investigate if using a mean-reverting strategy using cointegration can give any information about price movements in the traded assets. Any information we can derive from this strategy can be used as an factor in another larger model.

#### Conclusion
So far it hasn't been possible to get much edge in this strategy. That is, the different factors like Sharpe ratio and profit hasn't bee significant enough to

*Note: There seems to be some differences between the optimal paramters calculated and the optimal parameters for backtest. This is an issue I'm pursueing at the moment. Project will be opdated with my findings.*
